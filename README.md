# Making-A-Space-Game
Let's make a space game.
In this space game we will have a space ship and some enemies will moving in the screen from left to right and when they comes to the rightmost area, they will quickly come downwards for a certain distance and then start moving from right to left.
Opposite rule goes for the movement from right to left.
Our space ship can only moves right and left by pressing the arrow keys or D or A from keyboard.
We can also shoot by pressing Spacebar.
If any enemy can reach a certain red line then the game will be over.
